This webpage is my first project working with Front End Development. In here I put in practice some concepts which I have been studying for a while now. There is still a lot to improve but it's my start. :slightly_smiling_face:

The items practiced were:

 - Flex Box
 - Responsive images
 - API connection with JavaScript Promises
 - B.E.M Methodology
 - CSS Positioning
 - Responsive elements
 - CSS Specificity
